# Sidewalk Robot Outdoor Testing Code

This repository contains the code and configurations for the Sidewalk Robot project, focused on developing and modifying navigation algorithms for a Husky UGV to operate autonomously on sidewalks. The project primarily focuses on outdoor testing scenarios, ensuring the robot can navigate effectively in real-world environments.

The repository includes custom ROS packages and configurations designed to enhance the Husky's navigation capabilities. These modifications include adjustments for GNSS data collection, AMCL localization, and mapping processes.

The robot used in this project is provided by [CLEARPATH Robotics](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/robots/outdoor_robots/husky/user_manual_husky), and the model tested is the MCM07 HUSKY. This project is developed and tested on **Ubuntu 20.04** with **ROS Noetic**.

## Prerequisites

Ubuntu install of ROS Noetic guide is provided at the following link:
- [ROS Noetic Installation Guide](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

Install the Husky ROS navigation stack. To quickly install the navigation stack, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation
```

For full Husky UGV tutorials, please refer to the detailed guide provided by CLEARPATH Robotics at the following link:

### `launch/`

This directory contains launch files for various operations:

- **launch_mapping.launch**: Launch file for creating maps of the environment.

Sample usage:

```bash
# Start the mapping process using the launch file from the my_package package
roslaunch my_package launch_mapping.launch
```

```bash
# Save the map after scanning, specifying the filename prefix
rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/maps/my_map
```

- **launch_amcl.launch**: Launch file for running AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization).

Sample usage:

```bash
# Start the navigation process with the specified map and custom scan topic
roslaunch my_package launch_amcl.launch map_name:=my_map.yaml
```

- **duro_gnss_data_collection.launch**: Launch file for collecting GNSS data (not required for mapping and navigation).

Sample usage:

```bash
# Launch the Piksi Multi node using default settings
roslaunch my_package duro_gnss_data_collection.launch
```

### `maps/`

This directory contains pre-generated maps used by the navigation stack:

- **MARC_IndoorL1.pgm / .yaml**: Indoor map files.

  <img src="images/MARC_L1_pgm.jpg" alt="MARC L1 PGM" height="200px" />
</p>
<p align="center" style="font-size:14px;">
  <em>Left: Floor Plan | Right: Scanned Map for Highlighted Corner</em>
</p>

- **MARC_OutdoorGoogle.pgm / .yaml**: Outdoor map files from Google.

  <em>Left: Plan View Referenced from Google Map | Right: Scanned Map for Highlighted Path</em>
</p>

- **MARC_OutdoorTurn.pgm / .yaml**: Turn-specific outdoor maps.

### `rviz/`

This directory contains RViz configuration files for visualizing the robot’s environment and navigation:

- **robot_mapping.rviz**: RViz configuration for mapping.
- **robot_navigation.rviz**: RViz configuration for navigation.

### `src/`

This directory is reserved for custom source code related to the project.

## Installation and Setup

### Cloning the Repository

After installing the Husky ROS navigation stack, clone this repository into your ROS workspace:
